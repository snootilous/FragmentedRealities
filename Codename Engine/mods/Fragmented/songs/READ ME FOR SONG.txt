OK HI this is snoot your one and only codename fag fag homo fag

so the way that song files work in codename is p simple
----

[song name]
|-> charts
|   |-> [difficulty].json
|-> song
|   |-> Voices.ogg
|   |-> Inst.ogg
|-> scripts (optional)
|   |-> [script].hx

File directories should look like this for:
charts

[MOD]/songs/[songname]/charts
---
example:
faggotrons/songs/boner/charts

same should go for the song:

[MOD]/songs/[songname]/song
---
example:
awesomesex/songs/evil/song

-----------

Each song has a meta.json file.

that's where it stores the information for things like BPM, Stages, Difficulties, Icon, Display name, and other snoz.
It can be created within the chart editor.
If you import a psych chart in it, be SURE to change the bpm in the metadata or else it will automatically be set to 100.
